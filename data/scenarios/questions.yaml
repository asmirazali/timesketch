#                       -- Questions --
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# This is a config file to define questions that can be asked
# in Timesketch. A single question is by nature small in scope and tactical,
# something that can be answered by analysis, either automatically or by
# providing enough context so that an analyst can determine the answer.
#
# Each investigation may contain many questions, some dependent on the
# outcome of others, that is one question can determine that no further
# questions need to be asked,  or that several other questions need to be
# brought up, etc.
#
# These questions define what data needs to be present in order to
# be able to answer it, as well as what user supplied parameters may be
# required to be defined beforehand. It will then also define what set of
# analyzers, graph plugins and potential searches will be useful in order
# to answer the question and what conditions are sufficient
# in order to have the question answered.
#
# As described above, each of these isolated tactical questions are part
# of a bigger picture, part of an investigation, which sets out to answer
# a broader set of questions, which can then in hand be part of an even
# larger scenario.
#
# Each question consists of the following fields:
#
#                       -- metadata --
#       display_name        Simple string that contains the display name that
#                           be used in an UI to describe the question.
#
#       description         Further description of the question, what the
#                           question attempts to answer, whether it will
#                           require further manual analysis, etc.
#
#                       -- data requirements --
#       data_sources        A list of data sources (as defined in the

#                           present or are optional in the dataset in

#
#       parameters          A list of parameters that will be asked

#                           simple things like the username of the user
#                           the analyst is looking at, or a domain that
#                           they are interested in, that is some context
#                           that is needed in order for the question to be
#                           properly asked.
#
#                       -- context/enrichment --
#       analyzers           A list of analyzers that will be run on the
#                           dataset enrich the dataset.
#
#       graphs              A list of graph plugins that will assist the

#
#       searches            A list of search templates that will assist the

#
#                       -- answers --
#       answer_simple       If the answer can be simply derived from a search
#                           in the dataset, an answer source can be defined.
#                           It contains two section, a "must" or "must_not",
#                           which is a list of data finder defintions that all
#                           must or must not return True values. This can be
#                           used to define things that should be present in the
#                           dataset or should not be there in order to give
#                           an answer to the investigative question.
#
#       answer_analyzer     If the answer cannot be derived from a simple
#                           search a name of an analyzer can be provided
#                           that is specifically designed to answer this
#                           particular investigative question.
